### Abstract
---
Data-driven animation using a large human motion database enables the programing of various n    atural human motions. While the development of a motion capture system allows the acquisition of realistic human motion, segmen    ting the captured motion into a series of primitive motions for the construction of a motion database is necessary. Although mo    st segmentation methods have focused on periodic motion, e.g., walking and jogging, segmenting non-periodic and asymmetrical mo    tions such as dance performance, remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a specialized segmentation approach f    or human dance motion. Our approach consists of three steps based on the assumption that human dance motion is composed of cons    ecutive choreographic primitives. First, we perform an investigation based on dancer perception to determine segmentation compo    nents. After professional dancers have selected segmentation sequences, we use their selected sequences to define rules for the     segmentation of choreographic primitives. Finally, the accuracy of our approach is verified by a user-study, and we thereby sh    ow that our approach is superior to existing segmentation methods. Through three steps, we demonstrate automatic dance motion s    ynthesis based on the choreographic primitives obtained.

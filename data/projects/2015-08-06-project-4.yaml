description: <b>Abstract</b> <br>In this study, we develop and implement a method for transforming real-world textures. By applying a squeeze film effect to real-world textures, we make haptic textures reduced. This method could transform real-world textures, e.g., from paper-like to metal-like, from wood-like to paper-like, and so on. The textures provided by this system are inherently high resolution because real-world textures are used instead of synthesized data. We implemented a system using a 28-kHz transducer. Evaluations were conducted using a three-axis accelerometer.<br><br>Yoichi Ochiai\*, Takayuki Hoshi\*\*, Jun Rekimoto\*\*\*, Masaya Takasaki\*\*\*\*<br><br>\*The University of Tokyo, \*\*Nagoya Institute of Technology, \*\*\*Sony CSL \*\*\*\* Saitama University<br><br>All visual and video documents are available for the media and press(under CC2.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0).<br>All images are taken by Yoichi Ochiai / University of Tokyo (落合陽一/東京大学)<br><br><iframe width="650" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZSl57AM314" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
